### Game Collection

**Q: How does the Shelf Scanner work?**
A: Take a photo of your game shelf, and our AI will identify the games. You can review and confirm each game before adding it to your collection.

**Q: Why wasn't my game found in the scan?**
A: The AI works best with clear, well-lit photos. Some games (especially older or rare titles) may not be recognized. You can always add games manually.

A: Values are estimates based on available market data. Actual prices may vary depending on condition, region, and seller.
